## Installation

1. Enter `about:profiles`
2. Press `Open Folder` under Root Directory
3. Move the `chrome` folder and `user.js` file into the directory. (the user.js is optional)
4. Download the [hover card firefox extension](https://github.com/easonwong-de/Tab-Preview-On-Hover)
5. Note: This theme `requires` this extension to function properly


## Changes I like to do for this look
    1. Add the "flexible space" item to the top right to have dragging space with full tabs
    2. Add the settings, history, and downloads buttons to the toolbar
