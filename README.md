## Installation

1. Enter `about:profiles`
2. Press `Open Folder` under Root Directory
3. Move the `chrome` folder and `user.js` file into the directory. `(the user.js is optional if you have the required about:config values for custom css)`


## Changes I like to do for this look
    1. Add the "flexible space" item to the top right to have dragging space with full tabs
    2. Add the settings, history, and downloads buttons to the toolbar
